                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The <i>"Email Publisher"</i> project starts with the idea of management of newsletter type of mail messages,
                    as newsletters are widely known as just spam messages, some users might find them some sense of utility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main responsabilities of the platform would be viewing own emails for settings and statistics and
                    publishing them so other users can see certain newsletters.

                <h3>Product Scope</h3>
                <p>
                    The project's scope is to make use of as many entry level web technologies as possible,
                    from publishing and viewing emails, authentication using user email address and generated tokens,
                    to generating and viewing of statistics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To the upper mentioned backend technologies should be added a responsive web design using HTML and CSS,
                    database and AJAX interactions, all under the form of microservices.

                    <p>
                        A user can view all the titles of their published emails on the dashboard. They can also access the
                        associated statistics and access the link that has the published email. Moreover, the user can
                        change the tags of a published email in the dashboard. The tags define: when the published email
                        will be deleted, the absence or presence of a password and what it is, if it is present and
                        if the published email is visible to the user who published it or to everyone. The priority of this
                        feature is 7. This feature is based on the "Publishing an email" and "Authentication" feature.
                        It cannot exist without them, so they have a higher priority.
