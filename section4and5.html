                    A user can forward an email to an email address associated with the app using any email management
                    service (Gmail, Yahoo
                    etc.) and get their email published. Afterwards, they will receive an email containing the link for
                    the
                    published email. The priority for this feature is considered maximum, i.e. 9. Considering the fact
                    that
                    the name of the project itself is Email Publisher we consider this feature as the crucial one.

                    A user can generate the statistics of an email by clicking on the "statistics" button related to a
                    specific email. After that they will be redirected to the "statistics" page where they can find how
                    many
                    views the email has, what are the origin countries of the visitors and the number of visitors per
                    day
                    for a period of a week. The user can modify the grouping category of the visitors diagram and the
                    period for which all the diagrams are shown. Priority of this feature is 5, due to the fact that
                    other
                    features might come up as more needed. Also, this feature is not contained in the core of the
                    project.

                    The authentication is needed for associating published emails to users and giving them access to the
                    "Managing published emails" and "Generating and exporting statistics" feature. A user account is
                    created
                    when they forward their first email to our email address or through using our authentication page
                    after
                    submitting a valid token received through email. Due to the fact that authentication is needed for
                    storing the published emails and associating them with specific emails, the priority of this feature
                    is
                    8.

                    A user can view all the titles of their published emails on the dashboard. They can also access the
                    associated statistics and access the link that has the published email. Moreover, the user can
                    change the tags of a published email in the dashboard. The tags define: when the published email
                    will be deleted, the absence or presence of a password and what it is, if it is present and
                    if the published email is visible to the user who published it or to everyone. The priority of this
                    feature is 7. This feature is based on the "Publishing an email" and "Authentication" feature.
                    It cannot exist without them, so they have a higher priority.
